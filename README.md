# Tableau Directive for AngularJS

This is a simple application that demonstrates the use of an AngularJS directive for displaying Tableau dashboards. 

## Overview

This application was scaffolded using Yeoman's Gulp-Angular generator. It relies on Public Tableau Dashboards to demonstrate usage.

## Key Concepts 

This project makes use of Angular Directives, Tableau's Javascript API (which is included in the index.html file of this project), $scope, $on/$broadcast, and Angular Controllers. It abstracts the ability to apply filters to dashboards and set parameters within Tableau by using an Angular directive.
